These are my advent of code solutions. I'm starting in Rust but hopefully there's a broad range of languages represented here by the end :)

# Flake
To use the provided Nix Flake, open the project in your shell of choice and run:
```zsh
$ nix develop
```

Then, you should be dropped into a shell with all the correct tooling accessible for developing and building any of the included subprojects!

If you're using a GUI editor, start it from this shell. For example:
```zsh
$ nix develop
$ codium ./2024/day-1-historian-hysteria
```
